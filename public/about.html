<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Shivansh, I live in a beautiful city, Rohru. I am a student at the Graphic Era Deemed To Be University
 . In our family, we are two siblings. I have a younger brother.
  Our family consists of my brother, my father, my loving mother.</p>

<P>My father is a teacher, whereas my mother is a housewife. 
  A lot of caring moments and love is always what I get from everyone in my family.
   I am studying in one of the reputed college of India,
    which always led me to be motivated towards the future.</P>

<p>All of my virtues have been incorporated into me by my college and helping is one of them.
   My college always aims at the holistic development of a student and it 
   focuses on the fact that we develop both morally as well as academically. 
   It is always a part of learning that you try to inculcate virtues in yourself 
   by being an honest person. To be responsible and to adhere to your duties, is 
   what our college teaches us.</p>


<p>I am a very consistent and punctual in my class. 
  I always try to improve my skills and morals to become a better student. 
  I do this by helping my classmates with love and dedication.</p>

<p>I love to study storybooks as a pastime and Eminem is my favourite singer. 
 . I believe one should practice a lot of 
  sports to keep oneself healthy. A healthy mind works better. So, it is very important to keep yourself healthy 
  to get focused. I am also very fond of watching various movies and love dancing. I have learned many forms of dance, 
  ranging from hip-hop to break dance.</p>

<p>Being a lover of various dances, I also love to participate in various curricular activities at my college.
   I am an active participant in a bunch of fests organized by my college. Also, I have been a part of several 
   quizzes debates, and tabloids. I have a huge interest in quizzes and have bagged many awards and honours for my school.
    Moreover, I always try to keep myself very punctual to school and help poor people whenever I can.</p>

<p>I love to research the undiscovered things in this world which is why 
  I aspire to become a scientist just like my father and work for my country. 
  I am always thankful to my family and my friends for making me so humble and
   helping me every day by trying to show me the goal in the bunch of cloudy weather.</p>


<p>Life is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness. Getting always what we want,
   is not the nature of life. Thus, one needs to keep oneself always motivated to the highest level.
    Follow the footprints of the great men to never be discouraged and keep yourself focused on your goal‚Äù.</p>
